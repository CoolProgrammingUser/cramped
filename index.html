				Welcome to the repository of my essence. I created this website in an effort to provide a clearer picture of what type of person I am for my application to MIT. Here, you will find things I've done, circumstances I've experienced, and nerdiness I've acquired. Although any influence this website may have had on my admission decision has long since passed, I continue expanding this website because I like how it concentrates everything cool about me into one place. You might even describe this as me in a nutshell. For the employers I refer here, I think the portrayal of my personality and programming abilities continues to have some utility, although it's worth noting that most of this is rather informal. Maybe I'll fix that with a r&eacute;sum&eacute; section or something later.

				P.S. If something doesn't seem to be working like it should, switch your browser to the latest version of Google Chrome; that's what I test this on, and my cross-browser support may or may not be a little spotty (particularly for Internet Explorer).

					I was worried that this time, like last time, I wouldn't be able fully express what type of person I am in this application. In response, I created the website located at https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/cramped/<note-><div><div>The original URL was "https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/Cramped/".</div></div></note-> in the hopes that I could more effectively portray things like my personality, accomplishments, and creativity (not to mention my programming abilities). Although there's a lot to look at, I hope you at least skim over some of it because I've spent an absolutely massive amount of time on building it from scratch (that's where all of my time went in the activities section), and I really do think it helps you see a part of me that isn't especially apparent in this application.
