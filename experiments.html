I thought it could be all in my head, but then again, maybe it wasn't, and if so, was it caused by me or other people? After driving myself crazy going back and forth forever, I decided to finally get scientific about it and collect some data pertaining to male versus female interactions (excluding adults). The results are detailed below. The awkward columns and rows tacked onto the tables are the averages.

							This describes the ratio of boys to girls present within a reasonable talking distance of me at various locations. Since the bus would change from day to day, I recorded multiple ratios and averaged them out. The classes are color coded based on what day I had them: Tuesdays and Thursdays were purple days, and Wednesdays and Fridays were white days. Mondays were all-classes days which contained all classes except for Academic Advisory. "A" lunch was on Wednesdays and Fridays, and "B" lunch was on the rest of the days. The full week ratio combines all of ratios proportionally to how often they would apply across the week. That value is the only one that would apply to anything considering all of the conversations as a whole (such as the conversation initializers). Arrows point to equivalent ratios.

							Narrative

						<section>
							No matter where you look, girls compose a larger proportion than boys: More girls surrounding me than boys, more distinct girls talked to each day than boys, and more conversations held with girls than boys. It's clear that my impression that things weren't equal was accurate. However, that immediately leads to the bigger question of why that is.
						</section>
						<section>
							The first thing to consider is the disproportionate presence of girls near me. You could pose the theory that I consciously or subconsiously positioned myself near girls in order to talk to them more and therefore skewed the supposedly impartial presence data, but I'd like to mention that seating locations were pretty much set at the very beginning of the year, and I would typically just sit wherever there was room. Lunch and the bus had the most opportunity for preference, but the ratios there are almost identical to the week as a whole, so I'm considering any influence of preferential seating to be small enough to be ignored. By the way, an equally valid theory would be that girls flock to me wherever I go, and that couldn't be dismissed with the information available here, but my informal appraisal of the situation suggests that that also isn't the case, so I'm going to consider any influence there to also be negligible. I wish I had full-class data to compare to near-me data, but some places would've posed difficulties in acquiring that data (such as Band and lunch), and most places seemed reasonably even to me (although Psychology and Computer Science definitely were not, and I've since discovered that it takes a rather large difference for me to notice). Since talking to girls more could easily be explained by having more girls around me, it's necessary to take a closer look at exactly how much of a skew there is to determine whether that's the only meaningful contributor.
						</section>
						<section>
							Although I'm not sure how far it goes to suggest an explanation for the skew, I found it interesting how, regarding the unique people I talked to each day, the discrepancies between boys and girls was more exaggerated than the presence data for each corresponding day of the week (although Monday was close enough that it could be considered to be the same). I also found it interesting how there were only two days over the course of the entire study period when I talked to more distinct boys than girls (excluding the weekend which hardly counts anyway).
						</section>
						<section>
							The part I found most intriguing was the conversation initializers. Presumably, the most unbiased person or group would start conversations in a ratio closest to the ratio of who's around. ... It wasn't me. As a matter of fact, when you compare the full-week ratio of boys to girls (which is the only one that applies to this data) to the number of conversations started by other people, you can see that other people start conversations with me essentially exactly proportionally to their presence around me whereas <strong>I start conversations with girls about 66% more frequently than that baseline.</strong> That seems to be pretty compelling evidence that I prefer talking to girls over boys.
						</section>
						<section>
							However, this study isn't the whole story. There are many possible scenarios which could provide the exact same data but suggest an entirely different conclusion. <span class="elaborate obvious">{Examples}</span>
							<aside data-heading="Examples">
								For example, maybe I frequently make frivolous small-talk with girls, but I have long, meaningful conversations with boys. Maybe I notice girls more frequently looking sad or alone, so I reach out to them because I don't want them to be sad, and I know all to well what it's like to be alone. Maybe there are a lot of conversations where one person is bound to start talking if the other doesn't, but girls are slower than boys to be the first one to say something. Maybe I try to make friends with boys, but conversations with them just aren't as engaging as they are with girls, so I end up favoring the people who provide better conversations.
							</aside>
							Being the one whose life is being examined, I can provide anecdotal evidence that there aren't highly significant differences relating to the examples I just provided (if you click on the word), but I can't dismiss the possibility that those factors or others exist at a level sufficient to provide a noticeable difference in a statistical study such as this one. One major limitation of this study is that <strong>this was conducted only after I had firmly established my friendships.</strong> Perhaps the question shouldn't be, "Why am I talking to girls more?" but instead, "Why are more of my friends girls?" No one questions when people talk to their friends more than they talk to people they don't know as well, and I can say (also anecdotally) that I definitely felt closer to more girls than I did boys. However, not only can I not tell how many of my conversations were with my closer friends, but I also have no quantifiable way of determining why I became friends with those people and especially not whether some level of attraction was subconsciously involved in that process. I went into this armed with only a pencil and a calculator, and I have no control over what stage of my life I happen to be in at any given time, so I don't fault myself for not conducting a more thorough investigation, but I was left wanting more as I pondered the implications what little I was able to learn.

						Starting my second year of college
					</h3>
					<section>
						I wasn't satisfied with the limited amount of infomation I had to work with in the first study, so when I realized that I was about to have the perfect opportunity to track everything from the very beginning (because I was transferring) with the means of interpreting it (via my newfound programming knowledge), I couldn't pass it up (however grueling it may be). One unit of talking time is roughly equal to one minute. Everything else (and technically that as well) is ranked on a scale of 1-7. I started off ranking on a scale of 1-5, but I decided that wasn't granular enough, so I switched to the larger scale and converted the data preceding that to a 1-7 scale the best I could. The conversion isn't perfect, and it particularly leaves an imprint in the conversation enjoyability table, but it's reasonably accurate; however, paying attention to the data from only one scale size tends to increase the statistical significance.
					</section>
					<div class="details raw-data">
						<div class="summary">
							Raw conversation data
						</div>
						<section>
							This is close to what I would type into my phone to record the conversation data, and it's from this data (as displayed) where all the conversation display tables figure out what to fill in. I recorded the following data points: the person's name or identifier, their gender, how I knew them, who started the conversation, special indicators about the conversation (usually none), the length of the conversation, how much the other person contributed to the conversation, and how much I enjoyed the conversation. When I switched from a 1-5 scale to a 1-7 scale on September 22<sup>nd</sup>, I also added a measure of the density of speech within the conversation (placed between the length of the conversation and how much the other person contributed). Group conversations get a little more complicated to make sense of (as if the single-letter indicators aren't already a challenge), but when necessary, I specify distinctions between the people relative to the order I state their name or indicator.

								Notable considerations
							</div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Collecting the data was so grueling that I became less inspired to get involved in a conversation; however, I tried to fight this because I generally like talking to people, and I wanted accurate data. Also, once I was already involved in a conversation, I'd have to collect the same data no matter what, so there was no further influence after that.
								</li>
								<li>
									I have a tendency to rate things on an exponential (or similar) scale, so I'm much less likely to chose an extreme value on a scale; however, considering how I collected all of the data consistently, trends should still be apparent if given enough data.
								</li>
								<li>
									When it comes to the length of the conversations, the values were determined only by my impression of the length of the conversation, not by any objective measurement of time. I had general expectations for what I wanted each value to represent, and I calibrated the interpretation accordingly, but I could be off by a full value (on the 1-7 scale), and particularly when it comes to the higher values, that could amount to a very substantial amount of time (due to my exponential categorization). The length data isn't meaningless, but it's definitely the least accurate (and therefore the total talk time isn't very accurate either).
								</li>
								<li>
									I started designing the program to interpret the data before the study was concluded because I was impatient, and I knew it would take a really long time to design a respectable interpreter. Perhaps halfway though the study or so, I had preliminary data suggesting that I demonstrated a preference for females, but I knew the data was far from conclusive, and I didn't want to (intentionally) change my behavior because I wanted to have accurate data.
								</li>
								<li>
									I became good friends with one female and consequentially talked to them a lot. Not filtering out this person by filtering out at least the first top female causes many of the trends to be substantially different.
								</li>
								<li>
									I definitely feel more drawn to females, but I don't want to be biased, so I fight it. Determining the exact reason why I'm drawn to them and how effective I am at fighting the impulse are two of the major reasons for conducting this study.
								</li>
								<li>
									I'm more drawn to attractive people, especially (but not exclusively) females, but I don't want to be biased, so I fight it. Both out of potential ethical issues and the ease with which ratings of favorable appearance can be influenced by the situation, no such ratings are recorded.
								</li>
								<li>
									I tend to be more awkward in group settings.
								</li>
								<li>
									I'm generally quiet, although I like talking to people, and I frequently make an active effort to get to know people.
								</li>
								<li>
									When forming my conclusions, I tend to focus on trends that span multiple categories because it's easier for me to make sense of that than when all of the categories vary. For example, I'm more inclined to make note of when all conversations with females show a trend or when all mutually started conversations show a trend as opposed to when data varies by gender and initiator simultaneously.

								Advisories for interpreting the displayed data
							</div>
							<section>
								I do heavy processing and filtering of the data because I want my results to be as clear as possible, but because of the strict filtering (and potentially other things) peculiarities can arise in the data if you're not prepared for them. This identifies some of the issues I've come across when trying to validate my results. It's worth noting that, although these may have been the things I found, these same types of issues could be hidden in other aspects of the data. Luckily, the peculiarities are generally small and don't necessarily have a significant impact on my conclusions. I did find a significant impact on the enjoyability, but I took the issues into account when forming my conclusions.
							</section>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Group conversations are complicated.</strong> As I was debating how best to represent groups, I generally settled on the method of counting each participant of the group individually. This allows the size and gender composition of the group to be accurately represented, but it also results in the same conversation being counted multiple times. You can filter groups in or out in an effort to account for this, and in the custom tables, you can select for the number of group conversations which counts each group conversation once; however, due to many conversations having both male and female participants, a group conversation can be counted up to twice with that selection: once for any males and once for any females. This may or may not be adjusted in the future.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>New filters can change the top male(s) and female(s) filtered out.</strong> When I select the group conversations in the customizable tables with standard filtering, I get certain values, but when I then filter out conversations with individuals, I get slightly lower values. This is because the male and female I talk to most aren't necessarily involved in any group conversations, so when only groups are considered, different people are assigned as the people I talk to most, and upon filtering them out, the displayed values decrease slightly. This can be remedied by not filtering out the people I talk to the most. I'm also interested in adding the ability to filter out specific people to address this kind of problem.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>New filters can affect whether someone associated with someone else continues to be considered.</strong> When I select the group conversations in the customizable tables with standard filtering, I get certain values, but when I then filter out conversations with individuals, I get slightly lower values (even if the top male(s) and female(s) aren't filtered out like above). This is because I only had one-on-one conversations (roughly, according to the standards of the study) with a certain person who caused me to meet a number of other people, so when I filter out conversations with individuals, that person is also filtered out, and because the standard filtering also filters out people tracing back to someone who's filtered out, some people involved in group conversations are also filtered out. This can be remedied by checking the box to allow considering people even if their person of origin is filtered out. I'm also interested in adding the ability to filter out specific people to address this kind of problem.

It's an approximation because weird things happen in fringe cases, but I haven't been motivated to sift through the massive amount of data and processing I have in order to track down the tiny error that sometimes causes the values to be 5% or so less accurate. It may be important to note that these totals don't include random people (people who didn't get a designation because I didn't see them enough and/or I wouldn't be able to recognize them later). Essentially everyone I had a conversation of any length with received a designation, though, so random people shouldn't have too much of an influence.

							This table allows you to choose from and display basically any of the data I collected. Selecting from only the first box allows you to display whatever you chose whereas also selecting from the other two boxes allows you to do basic math between different types of data. The bottom row attempts to determine whether the differences in values are significant, but it's apparently unnecessarily difficult to convert into a likelihood of the differences being due to random chance (a p-value for all of those statisticians out there), so I've cut some corners to try to still allow me to determine whether the differences are scientifically significant: If a percentage is displayed, the value is almost useless, but if it's relatively low (<strong>&lt;80%</strong>), it could be worth clicking on the values above it and copying and pasting the lists into an online p-value calculator. If an ordinary number is displayed, that's a &chi;<sup>2</sup> value (chi square) which you could also paste into a (different) online calculator, but since it's a little more straightforward, you could just look for a number greater than or equal to <strong>3.841</strong> to determine whether the difference is meaningful (using the standard significance threshold of 0.05 and 1 degree of freedom). Please note that a &chi;<sup>2</sup> value may be displayed even when that wouldn't be a valid test for significance e.g. the values for the total lengths of conversations should be ignored because &chi;<sup>2</sup> only works when you're counting up how many of something there is (whereas the total lengths is adding together values of varying sizes). You should also mostly ignore any values displayed in the last row when math is applied to the data (by selecting 2 categories) because the statistical tests wouldn't necessarily continue being valid after that. The current standard filtering generally provides the highest chance of finding significant (and meaningful) results because it turns out that trying to factor in when I used a 5-point scale for the first month actually messes everything up, and adding in the small conversations provides much more data with relatively small changes in distribution, but you can feel free to play around with the old filtering if you'd like, particularly if you only care about things that aren't rated on a scale (like the number of conversations), and there are times when getting rid of the small conversations can be beneficial.

							March 2023 conclusions
						</div>
						<section>
							The data doesn't support the idea that I display preferential treatment towards girls. With the limitations of my data (most notably in size after filtering), that's technically all I can say with a respectable amount of certainty, but with the trends I've observed in the data, I've formed some dubiously valid ideas on how my data can reveal overarching gender differences in interactions and how those differences can result in my observations of acquiring a disproportionately large number of female friends. (By the way, it's only very late on 3/23/2023 that I've finally gotten around to interpreting enough of the data that I feel confident enough to provide a conclusion.)
						</section>
						<section>
							Although all of the tables provide their own value, and if there were were clear trends in any of them, they would definitely warrant my attention, I find that the aggregate tables provide the greatest insight because they combine enough data that the irregularities start to smooth out. One thing that caught me off-guard (and kind-of impressed me) was the the striking consistency with which I initiated conversations between males and females proportionately to the total number of them recorded. Interestingly, the number of recorded males is greater than the number of females which is in direct contrast to the slightly female skew in the data I collected specifically to tell me the proportions of the people surrounding me. However, I'm more inclined to put my faith in analyses of concrete data from actual conversations than I am in speculating on how an indefinite number of people should've influenced my results; it's definitely thought-provoking, though. Moving forward with the recorded number of males and females, it seems that there's a significantly greater tendency for males to start conversations with me than females, but the total time I talk to them altogether is roughly the same as females. Looking at the average conversation lengths, it seems that this is explained by a shorter average conversation length. In other words, males have more conversations with me, but the conversations don't last as long on average, so I end up talking to them about as much as females in the end. You could try to argue that I'm not as interested in talking to males, so I cause those conversations to end prematurely, but the lack of persistent differences in enjoyment of the conversations (from the enjoyability table) or in the number of conversations I start with males versus females doesn't support that hypothesis. Also, the conversations I start with males tend to last longer than the ones they start with me which could be seen as evidence of a partially successful attempt on my part to extend conversations I'm more invested into. (It could also be seen as evidence of me caring more about the things I want to talk about, but given how a significant fraction of the conversations I start begin by asking about the other person, I don't think that tells the whole story.) If these trends prove to be existent and persistent, they could provide a fairly clear path towards explaining my disproportionately large number of female friends: I don't think I'm alone in believing that stronger bonds are formed over longer, more meaningful conversations, and if males are less likely to provide those kinds of conversations, it's more likely for me to form stronger bonds with females. Moreover, although the data here does nothing to reinforce the presumption, it's commonly observable that females most commonly associate with females (and males with males), so starting to form bonds with one group more than the other can lead to a cascading effect where you're exposed to the friends of your friends who are in the same group, and you therefore become increasingly involved in the group. This can even happen outside of male/female groupings as was the case when I got to know a disproportionately large number of Japanese students after I got to know a few. This has a degree of circular logic to it, though, because I reference the tendency of males and females to stay within their groups in order to help explain why I'm not staying within my own group. If I had to choose a reason for why I tend to diverge (now, as opposed to when I was younger and didn't diverge at all for reasons I consider largely separate), it would probably be because I have a greater appreciation of meaningful conversation and deeper connections than the average male. That's not to say that there aren't plenty of males who do appreciate those things or that most males wouldn't likely end up appreciating those things if presented with the opportunity, but society's expectations of males generally involve some amount of masculine strength at the expense of emotional vulnerability and connection, and either as a result of bending under pressure or of convincing themselves that they actually want that for themselves, they end up supressing their emotions and not talking about them as much, so if I want to open up to people more, I may have better success doing that with females, and over a long period of time of having better luck with connecting to females, it's not hard to imagine how I could have proportions of friends similar to what I had at the end of high school. There are likely more factors at play than just that (not least of which is the heavy skew in my classes and biology club in my later years in college), but up until this point, I've only had theories and biased data to work with; now I can see hard evidence that it's unlikely that I'm giving anyone an unfair advantage, and there are hints at what could be the primary factors at play in what I observe about myself. I strongly suspect that most people think it's ridiculous how much effort I've put into resolving this question, but I'm both proud of my ability to find this answer and comforted by the idea that my efforts to treat everyone fairly have been largely successful even when control of my thoughts hasn't necessarily been as successful. I wish I would've found this out a long time ago, but I'm happy to know it now.

								</td>
								<td>
									Filtering peculiarities can obscure this trend. Also, the small aggregate table doesn't necessarily demonstrate this trend because the number of groups and participants in the "both" category for females is so much larger than the "them" category that adding "both" to "them" in that table causes the absolute values to be vastly different. Also again, the absolute values of the larger aggregate table are going to be closer to 1 than it seems like they should be because some members of the groups are filtered out, so it's possible to have a group conversation which seems to involve only one other person. Also again agin, it's theoretically possible that just more females are being filtered out than males, but I see no reason to believe why that would be the case.

									If I used as many words per minute with females as I did with males, the participation values would have to increase if the density increased since the female would have to be talking more to raise the density. Likewise, if I was hardcore flirting with every girl I met and raising the conversation density as a result, there would have to be a decrease in the participation values because they would be talking for a smaller percentage of the time. Since the participation values stay the same even though the density increases, I must be increasing my rate of speech by the same amount as females speak more than males.

									These results aren't as strong as other results because the trends aren't necessarily as uniform, and particularly when isolating groups or individuals, there aren't enough conversations under consideration to eliminate sampling error. When considered as a whole, there's enough data and trends start to emerge, but it's debatable how valid the trends are if they can't be reliably replicated in the division that has the biggest impact on trends (groups versus individuals). That division may exhibit (potentially conflicting) trends in this area, but it's hard to make sense of it.

								<td>
									Conversations with individuals don't necessarily show this trend due to the low number of mutual conversations. Also, when groups and individuals are considered together, it's hard to recognize any difference in density because the group values are lower overall, so density differences are washed out when added to the conversations with individuals which have higher density but limited mutual conversations.

									I'm awkward in groups, so I cause the density of group conversations to be smaller than with individuals.

									I'm less awkward in groups containing females because those groups are smaller.

								<td>
									A smaller number of participants in female group conversations, a highly dubious increase in conversation density in female group conversations, a highly dubious decrease in female participation (suggesting I spoke more), and a preexisting knowledge of me feeling less awkward in smaller groups
								</td>
								<td>
									The "me" and "them" categories of the female group conversations have so few conversations that any trends should be viewed with heavy skepticism, but they and the "both" category which has better data all would support this hypothesis.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Males are more inclined to talk to males, and females are more inclined to talk to females.
								</td>
								<td>
									The vast male/female differences in "them" conversations in number of conversations, total talk time per conversation, and number of unique people, in addition to general observations of more frequent same-gender associations
								</td>
								<td>
									The "both" category doesn't necessarily follow this trend, but there are other considerations for those conversations.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									I'm likely reasonably successful at regulating how much I talk to people
								</td>
								<td>
									The similarities between the number of group and individual conversations I started, as well as the talk time per conversation.
								</td>
								<td>
									My presumed success is based on the assumption that the male/female ratio should be equal. This contrasts to the greater number of males recorded which, itself, contrasts with the greater number of females present in my classes and perhaps the dining hall. Maybe those two conflicting factors even out or maybe I'm not quite totally successful, but the lack of a definitive difference suggests a fair amount of success.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Talking to the same females more frequently than males and feeling less awkward in the smaller groups containing females promotes deeper levels of friendship and leads to the observation that I acquire more female friends.
								</td>
								<td>
									The larger number of conversations per female, the previous hypothesis that I feel less awkward in female groups, and the knowledge that increased voluntary exposure facilitates the establishment of relationships
								</td>
								<td>
									If it was confirmed that females were associated with a higher conversation density and/or that they had a higher tendency to result in mutually started conversations, those things would also factor into the establishment of friendships because they would respectively increase the opportunity for getting to know them or increase the average enjoyment of conversations with them. However, this hypothesis doesn't disentangle cause and effect: It could be that I seek out repeat conversations with females rather than that it's just a peculiarity of circumstances, and it could be that I feel less awkward in group female conversations also specifically because they're female (although I don't need a study to tell me that the large group awkwardness is real). Moreover, if it was determined that I was seeking out repeat conversations with females, for instance, it would still be unknown whether that was because I was subconsciously (or consciously) attracted to them or whether it was because they just provide better conversation (or any other variety of explanation).

								<th>Why no answer</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Am I more likely to put conversations into the "both" category under certain conditions?
								</td>
								<td>
									Besides skewing the data, this could also indicate my attitude towards the conversation: For example, if I'm more likely to consider conversations started by females to be mutually started, it could be that I'm more eager to talk when approached by a female.
								</td>
								<td>
									A lack of substantial trends, no other conversation classifications to compare to, and an inability to disprove less-likely variations of related hypotheses
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Do females have a higher proportion of "both" conversations?
								</td>
								<td>
									This could be caused by females being more receptive to conversations with me or by me getting comfortable with females more quickly. Also, mutually started conversations have a higher enjoyability and could therefore lead to a higher likelihood of establishing a closer friendship.
								</td>
								<td>
									Insufficient data to validate the slight and disputably inconsistent trend
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									(How) do these trends change over time?
								</td>
								<td>
									It's possible that nothing would change using the standard filtering because people I knew previously (such as from a previous study) are filtered out, but if it did change, it would beg the question of why, and when it comes to tracking the changes of the interactions with the people I met in this study, it could help indicate which factors are associated with the formation of lasting friendships, and it could help indicate how the data from this study and that one could be applied to my study in high school.
								</td>
								<td>
									The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly shut down school before I had a chance to do a follow-up, and then I graduated.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Why are certain trends observed?
								</td>
								<td>
									Although I was originally interested in seeing whether any trends existed at all, I'm perhaps actually more interested in the reasons behind the trends. The reason for a trend can determine whether I should take action to change it, and the degree to which I'm to blame can change what course of action I should take.

									Insufficient experimental design for most explanations

						Working at a local pizzeria

							Raw data
						</div>
						<section>
							This is close to what I would type into my phone to record the conversation data, and it's from this data (as displayed) where the conversation display table figures out what to fill in. I recorded the following data points for every interaction: the person's name or identifier, their gender, roughly how old they were, who started the conversation, what the purpose of the conversation was, the circumstances of the conversation (usually nothing special), the length of the conversation, how much the talking was broken up over time, how much I contributed to the conversation, how favorably I felt during the conversation (mood), how favorable I think the topic(s) objectively should've been (topic), how much they were smiling, and how much I was smiling. The gender and age information can be associated with a name (and stored elsewhere), so you don't necessarily see that information here. I increased the amount of data I was collecting over time, and the beginning of the data traded in the two favorability aspects for a general enjoyability aspect and a measure of how uncomfortable I was. I was annoyed with myself for changing my data collection along the way again during this study, but luckily, I primarily added things rather than changed how other data is collected, so the earlier data is largely compatible with the later data. More details of the meanings of the data is located in the "Data details" section.

The main factors at play here are an 8:00am lab on Tuesday and Thursday which always had tons of homework due and a class that often had tons of homework due on Friday (and then there's tons of stuff to do in between there).

						This starts on the night between January 13, 2019 and January 14, 2019. Fun fact: In the last 7 weeks of this section, I intentionally fell asleep 13 times counting weekends and naps.

					Matching attire with weather conditions

				<section>
					Eventually, I got tired of guessing what I should wear based on weather conditions, so I started keeping track of what the weather was and what I thought I'd be comfortable wearing (once I felt what it was like outside). Temperature feeling corresponds to this gauge of what to wear: 1 = super warm clothing; 2 = coat and thick shirt; 3 = jacket and thick shirt; 4 = thick shirt; 5 = only long-sleeve shirt; 6 = short-sleeve shirt; 7 = shorts; 8 = super cool clothing. Results seem to suggest the following equation: temperature feeling = (actual temperature &times; 7.5 - wind &times; 2 + 1.047<sup>humidity</sup> - 2.4<sup>cloud cover</sup>) &divide; 60.375 - 3.07. Since this equation is too complicated for me to memorize (easily), I decided to make a simple app to do the math for me. Although this gives fairly accurate results, I established certain cut-offs to account for the slight discrepancies: 1.4, 2.5, 3.7, 4.5, 5.3, 6.2, 7.9
