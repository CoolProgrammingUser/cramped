				<h2>
					Ice Cream Oreo Cake
				</h2>
				<section>
					As an end of the year reward, my 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher was going to give us an Ice Cream Oreo Cake party if we could behave well enough to spell out a certain short phrase. (Every time we behaved well, another letter of the phrase would be written on the board, and every time we behaved badly, a letter would be erased.) As time went by, we weren't making very good progress towards getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, but plainly wanting to give us the party, my teacher made it easier and easier for us to get a letter. However, much to the dismay of myself and others, certain dumb people who couldn't get their act together started acting worse and worse as the end of the year approached, so we never ended up getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party. Since I wasn't going to get any Ice Cream Oreo Cake in class, I asked my teacher for the recipe so my parents could make it, but she told me how she would need to get the recipe from home or something, and after confirming that I'd be back next school year, she told me how she'd get me the recipe when I came back next year. Naturally, I would've much rather had the recipe before the summer, but whatever. Summer passes, and when I return to school, I'm ready to recieve the recipe. However, my (now former) teacher tells me how she still needs to get it from home (which isn't particularly shocking at the very beginning of the year when she likely forgot about the recipe over the summer, but it's still annoying). Since my mom was working at the school and driving me there, I was in a unique position to have a little unstructured time before and after school, so I could regularly follow up with my old teacher about the recipe. Day after day, week after week, month after month, she kept forgetting the recipe and/or had some other reason why she couldn't get it to me yet. Although I don't remember it well enough to say with certainty anymore, I'm pretty sure I was asking her about this just about every day (or maybe I waited a little while when she said a particular time of year was busy), but I continued having no success. Towards the end of 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I was getting worried about ever getting the recipe because I definitely wouldn't be coming back the next year after I went to middle school, and as I expressed my concerns to my old teacher one day, she abruptly had me follow her to the principal's office where she grabbed a random piece of paper and wrote down the recipe from memory. I wondered why she didn't just do that in the first place, but I also suspected she didn't have the recipe memorized until I pestered her about it constantly (although I didn't tell her any of that). I was very happy to finally get the recipe, and although it was really irritating that other people in my class prevented me from having the Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, I suppose it all worked out in the end because I've since had much more Ice Cream Oreo Cake than I ever would've had at that one party.

					Band teacher codes
				</h2>
				<section>
					I've made codes throughout my life, and part of the fun of codes is confusing people with encrypted messages, so it wasn't uncommon for me to write such messages for people, including my middle school band teachers. Band was always a less structured and more inviting class than my other classes, so I felt more empowered to do weird things. On or around December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2009, I used my go-to code to write my first encoded message to the band teachers. ("It's amazing you accually solved this") You'll notice how I use the word "first" because that was far from the only encoded message I gave them. At fairly regular intervals, I would ask about their progress on deciphering the code, and whenever I decided they needed more incentive to figure it out, I would give them another encoded message. Sometimes, the reason I would give them another message would be because they would claim that they had deciphered my message(s), but based on how they refused to provide any proof of doing so (like saying what the message said), I figured they were just trying to get me to quit <span class="elaborate">nagging them</span>, so I would write a new message which they invariably couldn't read.
					<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
						Okay, let's just be clear here that, although I was persistent, I tried to make sure I didn't become a bother. There were some days when the band teachers didn't seem like they were having a good time, so I would let it go, and even when I was prompting them to work on my code, I put effort into making sure I didn't push so hard that it wasn't fun anymore. I may not have let them forget about my code, but to the best of my ability, I only did so in a way that didn't create a true irritation for them.
					</aside>
					This sort of thing would also happen when they claimed to have lost the message. (It may be that all additional messages had a specific reason to be written, and I just don't remember anymore.) The band teachers had no shortage of excuses about why they weren't getting anywhere, and despite my frequent prompting, this continued for quite a long time. Since those were the only two band teachers for the whole middle school (and I took band through all of middle school), I had them as my teachers for the next two years, and the saga of my encoded messages continued throughout that time. Somewhere along the line, I decided to occasionally write encoded messages on the white board before class as another means of keeping my code at the forefront of their minds (and perhaps also as a means of decreasing direct nagging), but it made little difference.
				</section>
				<section>
					Towards the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade, though, there was a major development. Leading up to this time, one of the band teachers had started taking over as the one who seemed like they may actually solve my code one day, and with the end of my middle school career approaching, she was running out of time. Towards the end of the year, though, she claimed that she had figured out my code. Considering how I had heard this story before, I wasn't very keen to believe it, and naturally, she had "forgotten" the code stuff at home, so she couldn't provide proof; however, she did seem a little more insistant than during previous claims of success. Still doubtful, I proceeded to write an encoded message on the white board, and as I was writing it, the band teacher was correctly reading to me what I was writing. It may have taken 2.5 years, but she had actually deciphered my code. That wasn't the end of the story, though.

					<img src="images/The Code enhanced.jpg" class="vert-media" style="float:right">
					Having endured years of pestering about solving my code, the band teacher wasn't satisfied with just figuring out what my messages said; she needed to find a way to try to get back at me. As such, she made her own encoded message which she tasked me with deciphering. I vowed to conquer her code, but with the end of the year so near, there was other stuff going on and not much time for me to demonstrate my victory to her. I wasn't able to find a solution before I graduated from middle school, but I refused to be beaten, and I continued to work on it afterwards. What I inevitably discovered, though, was that there wasn't enough context for me to work with: When approaching the decryption of codes, it's typically helpful to use the frequency of appearance of certain symbols to guide your guesses of the correct letter. Moreover, you can use the placement of symbols within words (assuming the spaces are obvious) to help eliminate some potential options. With the code the band teacher provided, the spaces were obvious, but there were only 4 words. If you were to arbitrarily assign a unique letter to each unique symbol (besides the exclamation point and what's obviously a space), the message would be "abcde fgh ij kflme!" A frequency analysis with 4 words is completely meaningless, and there are very few opportunities to narrow down potential options based on symbol placement. To worsen the situation, it was possible that the first symbol was a capital with a different symbol from its lowercase equivalent since she may have wanted to provide me with the same level of difficulty as my own code. That isn't a problem if the letter isn't used elsewhere, but it becomes a significant problem if one of the other letters is the same as the first one. I spent a lot of time trying to systematically eliminate possible symbol decryptions, and I racked my brain for possible word combinations that would make sense in this context, but there are just too many words, so I couldn't go through every possiblity, and I couldn't narrow down what letters never appear in a certain place in a word very well at all. I could've gone through the dictionary and kept track of how every word might fit into the code, but that would've taken months if not years of intense work, and I still might not have been able to get the information that I needed. With seemingly insurmountable obstacles surrounding me on all sides, I reluctantly had to set the code aside... for a while, that is...

					Since I can't copy and paste the rest of the story like I did for everything before this, I'm going to leave you with a cliffhanger. I'd say I'm sorry, but I enjoy leaving people with cliffhangers too much for that to actually be true. If it makes you feel any better, though, this story is still ongoing, and during the part I couldn't copy and paste, I made <a href="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/decoder/">this website</a>.

					Occasionally, when it was someone's birthday in band (in high school), we would play the Happy Birthday song for them; however, no one knew how to play it. I tried getting the band teachers to give us the music, but apparently, they didn't have it and weren't too eager to try to get it. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I got to work. For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it. After countless trials and tribulations, I finally finished the music and it was handed out... to only first-hour band (my hour). Even though the music was eventually printed up for second-hour band, the teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out; it wasn't until I came to school early one day, set up all the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music onto each chair, that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors were recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.

					Every once in a while during my time in high school band, someone's birthday would come around and we would play the Happy Birthday song for them. There was only one problem: No one actually knew how to play the Happy Birthday song. Whenever we were called upon to play the song, we basically just played random notes that we hoped were kind-of close to the real tune. (Our main teacher liked calling it Happy Birthday in Z&#x266d;.) This had bothered me for some time, but when I asked for music for the Happy Birthday song to be handed out so we could play it correctly, I was told that they didn't have the music. Not content with believing that there was no way for us to play the song correctly, I would occasionally bring up the subject again, insisting that there had to be some way of getting the music to such a common song. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, instead of asking for the music to be procured for me, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I was told about a free music composing program that I could use (<a href="https://musescore.org/" target="_blank">MuseScore</a>). For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every single instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it; the Happy Birthday song for my birthday was played in the key of Z&#x266d;. After an immense learning curve, problems at every turn, and absolutely no help from the band teachers (despite how I requested it), I finally finished the music and it was handed out... to only first-hour band (my hour). Even though the music was eventually printed up, the band teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out for second-hour band; it wasn't until I came into school early one day, set up all of the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music onto each chair generally corresponding to the instrument of the person who would sit there, that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors were recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.
