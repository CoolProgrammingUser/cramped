					Occasionally, when it was someone's birthday in band (in high school), we would play the Happy Birthday song for them; however, no one knew how to play it. I tried getting the band teachers to give us the music, but apparently, they didn't have it and weren't too eager to try to get it. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I got to work. For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it. After countless trials and tribulations, I finally finished the music and it was handed out... to only first-hour band (my hour). Even though the music was eventually printed up for second-hour band, the teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out; it wasn't until I came to school early one day, set up all the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music onto each chair, that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors were recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.

					Every once in a while during my time in high school band, someone's birthday would come around and we would play the Happy Birthday song for them. There was only one problem: No one actually knew how to play the Happy Birthday song. Whenever we were called upon to play the song, we basically just played random notes that we hoped were kind-of close to the real tune. (Our main teacher liked calling it Happy Birthday in Z&#x266d;.) This had bothered me for some time, but when I asked for music for the Happy Birthday song to be handed out so we could play it correctly, I was told that they didn't have the music. Not content with believing that there was no way for us to play the song correctly, I would occasionally bring up the subject again, insisting that there had to be some way of getting the music to such a common song. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, instead of asking for the music to be procured for me, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I was told about a free music composing program that I could use (<a href="https://musescore.org/" target="_blank">MuseScore</a>). For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every single instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it; the Happy Birthday song for my birthday was played in the key of Z&#x266d;. After an immense learning curve, problems at every turn, and absolutely no help from the band teachers (despite how I requested it), I finally finished the music and it was handed out... to only first-hour band (my hour). Even though the music was eventually printed up, the band teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out for second-hour band; it wasn't until I came into school early one day, set up all of the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music onto each chair generally corresponding to the instrument of the person who would sit there, that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors were recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.
