					Ice Cream Oreo Cake
				</h2>
				<section>
					As an end of the year reward, my 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher was going to give us an Ice Cream Oreo Cake party if we could behave well enough to spell out a certain short phrase. (Every time we behaved well, another letter of the phrase would be written on the board, and every time we behaved badly, a letter would be erased.) As time went by, we weren't making very good progress towards getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, but plainly wanting to give us the party, my teacher made it easier and easier for us to get a letter. However, much to the dismay of myself and others, certain dumb people who couldn't get their act together started acting worse and worse as the end of the year approached, so we never ended up getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party. Since I wasn't going to get any Ice Cream Oreo Cake in class, I asked my teacher for the recipe so my parents could make it, but she told me how she would need to get the recipe from home or something, and after confirming that I'd be back next school year, she told me how she'd get me the recipe when I came back next year. Naturally, I would've much rather had the recipe before the summer, but whatever. Summer passes, and when I return to school, I'm ready to recieve the recipe. However, my (now former) teacher tells me how she still needs to get it from home (which isn't particularly shocking at the very beginning of the year when she likely forgot about the recipe over the summer, but it's still annoying). Since my mom was working at the school and driving me there, I was in a unique position to have a little unstructured time before and after school, so I could regularly follow up with my old teacher about the recipe. Day after day, week after week, month after month, she kept forgetting the recipe and/or had some other reason why she couldn't get it to me yet. Although I don't remember it well enough to say with certainty anymore, I'm pretty sure I was asking her about this just about every day (or maybe I waited a little while when she said a particular time of year was busy), but I continued having no success. Towards the end of 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I was getting worried about ever getting the recipe because I definitely wouldn't be coming back the next year after I went to middle school, and as I expressed my concerns to my old teacher one day, she abruptly had me follow her to the principal's office where she grabbed a random piece of paper and wrote down the recipe from memory. I wondered why she didn't just do that in the first place, but I also suspected she didn't have the recipe memorized until I pestered her about it constantly (although I didn't tell her any of that). I was very happy to finally get the recipe, and although it was really irritating that other people in my class prevented me from having the Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, I suppose it all worked out in the end because I've since had much more Ice Cream Oreo Cake than I ever would've had at that one party.

					Band teacher codes
				</h2>
				<section>
					I've made codes throughout my life, and part of the fun of codes is confusing people with encrypted messages, so it wasn't uncommon for me to write such messages for people, including my middle school band teachers. Band was always a less structured and more inviting class than my other classes, so I felt more empowered to do weird things. On or around December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2009, I used my go-to code to write my first encoded message to the band teachers. ("It's amazing you accually solved this") You'll notice how I use the word "first" because that was far from the only encoded message I gave them. At fairly regular intervals, I would ask about their progress on deciphering the code, and whenever I decided they needed more incentive to figure it out, I would give them another encoded message. Sometimes, the reason I would give them another message would be because they would claim that they had deciphered my message(s), but based on how they refused to provide any proof of doing so (like saying what the message said), I figured they were just trying to get me to quit <span class="elaborate">nagging them</span>, so I would write a new message which they invariably couldn't read.
					<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
						Okay, let's just be clear here that, although I was persistent, I tried to make sure I didn't become a bother. There were some days when the band teachers didn't seem like they were having a good time, so I would let it go, and even when I was prompting them to work on my code, I put effort into making sure I didn't push so hard that it wasn't fun anymore. I may not have let them forget about my code, but to the best of my ability, I only did so in a way that didn't create a true irritation for them.
					</aside>
					This sort of thing would also happen when they claimed to have lost the message. (It may be that all additional messages had a specific reason to be written, and I just don't remember anymore.) The band teachers had no shortage of excuses about why they weren't getting anywhere, and despite my frequent prompting, this continued for quite a long time. Since those were the only two band teachers for the whole middle school (and I took band through all of middle school), I had them as my teachers for the next two years, and the saga of my encoded messages continued throughout that time. Somewhere along the line, I decided to occasionally write encoded messages on the white board before class as another means of keeping my code at the forefront of their minds (and perhaps also as a means of decreasing direct nagging), but it made little difference.
				</section>
				<section>
					Towards the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade, though, there was a major development. Leading up to this time, one of the band teachers had started taking over as the one who seemed like they may actually solve my code one day, and with the end of my middle school career approaching, she was running out of time. Towards the end of the year, though, she claimed that she had figured out my code. Considering how I had heard this story before, I wasn't very keen to believe it, and naturally, she had "forgotten" the code stuff at home, so she couldn't provide proof; however, she did seem a little more insistant than during previous claims of success. Still doubtful, I proceeded to write an encoded message on the white board, and as I was writing it, the band teacher was correctly reading to me what I was writing. It may have taken 2.5 years, but she had actually deciphered my code. That wasn't the end of the story, though.
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="images/The Code enhanced.jpg" class="vert-media" style="float:right">
					Having endured years of pestering about solving my code, the band teacher wasn't satisfied with just figuring out what my messages said; she needed to find a way to try to get back at me. As such, she made her own encoded message which she tasked me with deciphering. I vowed to conquer her code, but with the end of the year so near, there was other stuff going on and not much time for me to demonstrate my victory to her. I wasn't able to find a solution before I graduated from middle school, but I refused to be beaten, and I continued to work on it afterwards. What I inevitably discovered, though, was that there wasn't enough context for me to work with: When approaching the decryption of codes, it's typically helpful to use the frequency of appearance of certain symbols to guide your guesses of the correct letter. Moreover, you can use the placement of symbols within words (assuming the spaces are obvious) to help eliminate some potential options. With the code the band teacher provided, the spaces were obvious, but there were only 4 words. If you were to arbitrarily assign a unique letter to each unique symbol (besides the exclamation point and what's obviously a space), the message would be "abcde fgh ij kflme!" A frequency analysis with 4 words is completely meaningless, and there are very few opportunities to narrow down potential options based on symbol placement. To worsen the situation, it was possible that the first symbol was a capital with a different symbol from its lowercase equivalent since she may have wanted to provide me with the same level of difficulty as my own code. That isn't a problem if the letter isn't used elsewhere, but it becomes a significant problem if one of the other letters is the same as the first one. I spent a lot of time trying to systematically eliminate possible symbol decryptions, and I racked my brain for possible word combinations that would make sense in this context, but there are just too many words, so I couldn't go through every possiblity, and I couldn't narrow down what letters never appear in a certain place in a word very well at all. I could've gone through the dictionary and kept track of how every word might fit into the code, but that would've taken months if not years of intense work, and I still might not have been able to get the information that I needed. With seemingly insurmountable obstacles surrounding me on all sides, I reluctantly had to set the code aside... for a while, that is...
				</section>
				<section>
					I was originally going to leave you with a cliffhanger because I couldn't copy and paste the rest of the story, but I dug up a relevant email I sent to the band teacher which I think explains a lot, so I'll provide that for you here.

					<section>
						<strong>My message sent in the early morning hours of May 12, 2017:</strong>
					</section>
					<section>
						Hello, this is Robbie Benson, the crazy red-headed person who wrote you a bunch of encoded messages between the years of 2009 and 2012. If you recall, after pestering you for years and giving you tons of hints, you finally figured out my code, and as revenge, you gave me a message in a code of your own (included as an attachment in this email). I refused hints and told you I'd figure it out myself. I email you today to admit defeat. However, this surrender doesn't come without a significant effort to prevent it. Before I go into that, though, I'd like to enlighten you on some facts regarding the message you gave me:
					</section>
					<section>
						First off, I'd like to point out how you only gave me <em>four words</em> to work with. Given such a small sample, it's impossible to use statistical methods to effectively fill in some of the most-used symbols and guess at words. As such, I was left to try every possibility until I came across a valid solution. Assuming that the second and fourth symbols are different (as I do for all of these figures), if I tried systematically substituting in every letter of the alphabet for each of the symbols (excluding the ones which are obviously spaces), I would have to try up to 6.476&times;10^16 different possibilities before I reached an answer. If it took me 1 second to go through each of those possibilities, it would take me over 2.05 billion years (that's 45% of the age of the earth). But let's assume I didn't do things that way (which I didn't). Instead, let's assume I have a list of all English words, and I only have to figure out which ones fit the code. Let's also say that I managed to organize every word according to length and letter pattern, so I only had to go through the words of the correct length and with the correct number and placement of repeating letters. With these assumptions, the first word would have 946 possibilities, the second would have 268, the third would have 33, and the fourth would also have 946. Together, this comes to a grand total of 7,914,637,104 possibilities. For this, let's assume I can go through each possibility in 0.1 seconds because some words just wouldn't make sense together, and I'd skip a bunch of possibilities (although it's still a stretch). If I worked non-stop, it would still take me 25.1 years to cover every possibility. Suddenly your "simple" code doesn't seem so simple anymore now does it?
					</section>
					<section>
						So the question arises, how did I even go about finding a solution? Well, knowing that such an imposing number of possibilities was well beyond my abilities, I was deterred for quite some time. However, after taking a computer science class, I rediscovered your code and was gripped with inspiration. Although I went through a number of redesigns, I finally designed a website (found <a href="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/decoder/">here</a>) with the ability to take on your code. Despite it's ability to go through each possibility in 1.28 microseconds, it still takes my website about 2.8 hours to come up with the possible solutions. In the end, with solutions only comprising of English words (along with a few nonsense words because of the word list I used) which correctly match the symbol pattern throughout the entire message, I'm left with 384,926 solutions. If it took me 0.1 seconds to go through each solution, it would have taken me 44.55 days to get to the end. Not liking that time, I designed faster and faster ways of sifting through the results until I arrived at a speed of about 100,000 solutions every 30 minutes. In my search through the solutions, I came across some that just didn't make sense grammatically (and skipping those is how I managed to go so fast); others, however, are valid sentences, but I don't think they make sense in context. Some of those include, "Blame our TV noise!", "Flush and go march!", and "Slide out by force!". Once I reached the end of the solutions, I tried assuming the second and fourth letters were the same, and after 9.4 minutes, I got results such as, "Never sit by Oscar!" but none which I could believe were the intended sentence. Maybe I misjudged what words would be in the message and accidentally skipped over where the result would be; maybe I somehow managed to filter out the real solution by some mistake in my program; maybe the first letter is actually a capital of a letter used elsewhere, and my program doesn't know how to deal with it yet. Regardless of the reason, I was unable to pinpoint the solution to your message, and I'm at a loss to come up with any other means of arriving at the answer (which could be accomplished any time soon). With this statement of defeat, I ask for the solution to this code which has plagued me for five years (if you can still remember).

						<strong>The band teacher's response later the same day:</strong>
					</section>
					<section>
						Robbie,
					</section>
					<section>
						I can only begin to tell you the shock I was in when I opened my email this morning and found an email from you!  I absolutely remember you...and your incessant middle school codes!!  :) Not only did I never expected to hear from you...I would have never guessed that you still had that code, let alone tried to figure it out!  Ha!  That's awesome!
					</section>
					<section>
						So, first, before I attempt to put your mind at rest about the solution...let me say this.  I think it's absolutely hilarious that you came up with all those statistics about some goofy cryptic response I gave to you as a middle schooler.  I remember you walking into my office, almost on a daily basis, asking if I figured out your code.  Sometimes you would just walk by in silence, making sure I was aware that you were patiently waiting for my solution.  In all honesty, many times I wouldn't even have had a chance to look at it yet, but I would tell you that I was close to solving it.  I actually thought it was pretty clever that you came up with your codes in the first place. And...I must admit...I was pretty stellar at solving them.
					</section>
					<section>
						Second...you probably didn't know this, but before I was a band director, I was a math major in college. I love numbers and statistics and find great "geeky humor" in your very thorough explanation of your attempt at the solution. I understand your statistical dilemma and impressively applaud your problem solving skills. Bravo!
					</section>
					<section>
						Third, and probably most unfortunate, is that I have no recollection of what I was actually trying to say. I am sure I was trying to come up with something humorous in response to your codes...but it's been quite a while and I cannot say that I remember!!!! I am so sorry!!! I feel terrible that I cannot provide better closure!
					</section>
					<section>
						By the way...you should know that I was absolutely delighted to hear from you and got a real kick out of reading your "code saga". I've shared this story with several people at school today. It brought a smile to my face. It's always great to hear how former students are doing. :)
					</section>
				</div>
				<section>
					As you can imagine, I wasn't satisfied by this resolution, but there's only so much time in the day. Not knowing what the encoded message said is not an option, so I'll be revisiting and refining my decoder website, but I've had other priorities in the meantime. This isn't over, though.

					Occasionally, when it was someone's birthday in band (in high school), we would play the Happy Birthday song for them; however, no one knew how to play it. I tried getting the band teachers to give us the music, but apparently, they didn't have it and weren't too eager to try to get it. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I got to work. For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it. After countless trials and tribulations, I finally finished the music and it was handed out... to only first-hour band (my hour). Even though the music was eventually printed up for second-hour band, the teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out; it wasn't until I came to school early one day, set up all the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music onto each chair, that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors were recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every once in a while during my time in high school band, someone's birthday would come around and we would play the Happy Birthday song for them. There was only one problem: No one actually knew how to play the Happy Birthday song. Whenever we were called upon to play the song, we basically just played random notes that we hoped were kind-of close to the real tune. (Our main teacher liked calling it Happy Birthday in Z&#x266d;.) This had bothered me for some time, but when I asked for music for the Happy Birthday song to be handed out so we could play it correctly, I was told that they didn't have the music. Not content with believing that there was no way for us to play the song correctly, I would occasionally bring up the subject again, insisting that there had to be some way of getting the music to such a common song. During senior year, after repeated failures of requests for action, I decided to take matters into my own hands: This time, instead of asking for the music to be procured for me, I asked if the music would be handed out if I made it myself. Since that required very little effort on the teachers' part, it was agreed, and I was told about a free music composing program that I could use (<a href="https://musescore.org/" target="_blank">MuseScore</a>). For well over a month, I labored away at creating two parts of music for every single instrument in the band. I had hoped to finish before my birthday, but circumstances prohibited it; the Happy Birthday song for my birthday was played in the key of Z&#x266d;. After an immense learning curve, problems at every turn, and absolutely no help from the band teachers (despite how I requested it), I finally finished the music and it was handed out... to only first-hour band (my hour). Even though the music was eventually printed up, the band teachers just couldn't manage to hand it out for second-hour band; it wasn't until I came into school early one day, set up all of the chairs for second-hour band, and put a sheet of music onto each chair generally corresponding to the instrument of the person who would sit there, that second-hour finally had the ability to play the Happy Birthday song. As a result of this ordeal, during our last concert of the year when the seniors were recognized, the band teachers acted like they forgot about me.
